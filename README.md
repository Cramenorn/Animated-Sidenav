# Animated Sidenav

The main purpose of this project is to show you how to create a side navigation menu with animation. 
I included other features like the fixed navbar and footer, the side bar will appear when you are on the mobile version if you click on the hamburger icon, to be more specific the screen resolution must be less than 769px.

## What do i need to make the website work ?

You must use a browser like **Chrome** or **Firefox** then you just need to copy and paste your folder path in the browser with the **index.html** file include.
